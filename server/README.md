# Graphql - Server

- Schema => type definitions + resolvers

## Directives

- allows us to add logic and metadata to the schemas, queries, or mutations
- act like middleware for the schemas, or post processing hooks for the queries and mutations.

### Why use directives?

- Fine-grain control down to the level on the TypeDefs
- Eliminate post processing on the clients after the query
- Extendable
